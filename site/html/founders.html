                        <h2>John Caveson</h2>
                        <p>Born: 1923 Died: 1990</p>
                        <p>Position: Founder of precursor to Coolio Games, Caveson Toys</p>
                        <p>
                            John Caveson was the founder of Caveson Toys, the precursor to Coolio Games. He was born and raised in Bradford, West Yorkshire but moved
                            to Sheffield in 1958 and worked at Focal Science Inc. before founding his company. Caveson Toys was a beloved local toy shop in Broomhill which attracted many visitors and
                            upon John's death the shop was sold and is now currently a Tesco Express shop. In his youth, John loved to play football and was always an avid supporter
                            of Bradford Park Avenue, but despite his prodigal ability as a striker he always spent most of his time playing with wooden toys his father would make as 
                            he was a carpenter. In his 30s John would face pressure from his parents as they wanted him to pursue the career of a scientist. Making his
                            parents happy, John would go on to study physics at the University of Hull for 3 years and found himself a job at Focal Science Inc. just a few weeks after
                            graduating. John worked his way up the ladder, eventually becoming the head of the company after 10 gruelling years, but John felt lost as he had nothing left
                            to work for and so founded a small toy shop that he would run in his spare time. Eventually he became so fond of it that he quit his job at Focal Science and
                            worked to produce toys full time. John unfortunately passed away in 1990 due to lead poisoning and his shop was originally passed on to his daughter Freya, who made
                            the decision to turn her father's toy company into a game company in 1991, still capturing the child-friendly nature of the company. John lives on forever in our hearts and
                            inspires us to work hard each day.

                        <h2>Freya Butterfield</h2>
                        <p>Born: 1970</p>
                        <p>Position: Founder of Coolio Games and CEO from 1991-2019</p>
                        <p>
                            Freya Butterfield spent the majority of her childhood in her father's toy shop, playing with all the toys her father would craft. In her teenage years she would work there
                            at weekends and loved every minute of it: whether it was stocking shelves or making the toys herself Freya would always be dedicated to her father's business. In the 1990s when the
                            World Wide Web was only a year old and the Internet was yet to become as popular as it is today, Freya saw an opportunity to shift her father's company into the digital world. 
                            As she did more research into computing she became more and more excited about its possibilities, but it was the idea of developing video games that she was most passionate about.
                            In November 1991 Coolio Games developed their first game: "Magic Adventure", an educational game for the PC involving a hero trying to navigate a maze. The game was written by 5 members:
                            Freya Butterfield, Gilbert Freedmont, Elliot Vaunce, William Bern and Zach Muller. Unfortunately these 5 members no longer work at Coolio Games except Freya, who occasionally oversees
                            operations. Freya Butterfield helped the company win multiple awards and still aims to capture her father's vision of entertaining children.

                        <p>Born: 2002</p>
                        <p>Position: CEO (as of 2021)</p>
                        <p>
                            Freddie Butterfield grew up with a natural curiosity for computers and by the age of 6 was learning to program with the help of his mother. It was his ambition to one day work alongside
                            his mother at the top of the company, and so started working there from the age of 15 whilst he studied at school. Through a series of promotions, Freddie was finally working at the top
                            of the company by the age of 18 and accomplished his dream. Just a year after, Freya Butterfield retired, believing that Freddie was ready to take over the company. Freddie has worked hard
                            to maintain the reputation of Coolio Games and within a month won the "Best Education Game" at the D4 Expo for our highly anticipated upcoming game: Magic Adventure II. Freddie strives to 
                            make Coolio Games even better than before and develop the company to its fullest potential.
