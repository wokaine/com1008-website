                            It has been 30 years since Freya Butterfield turned her fathers company into Coolio Games, taking it to win multiple awards. We at Coolio Games are celebrating
                            the event with pizza bought using Magic Adventure II's budget! However it can't be party time all the time... we are still working very hard on finalizing Magic Adventure II.
                            A statement from Freya: "We've had 30 years of excellence, let's make it 31. The budget? We will simply make money"

                            Magic Adventure II is on its way! We have made a lot of progress since the D4 demonstration and have added many new features that users are sure to enjoy.
                            One of the features we are most excited about is the revamped turn-based combat system from the first game, but unfortunately we can't say too much about it.
                            We hope that everyone will be able to enjoy the game, and it is set to release on the 14th of December. At this stage we are currently ironing out bugs so that
                            the game is perfect when it comes out. CEO Freddie Butterfield says: "This is our most ambitious project since Scrimbly Binbo 5, I think this is a game that both kids
                            and adults will enjoy."
