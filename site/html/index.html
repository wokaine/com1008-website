                <h2>Welcome to our website!</h2>
                <p>Here at Coolio Games&trade; we are dedicated to producing interactive puzzle games for children. 
                    Originally we were founded under the name of Caveson Toys in 1970 by our founder
                    John Caveson as a toy company branching from Focal Science Inc. However, in 1990 John unfortunately passed 
                    away and his daughter Freya inherited the company. In 1991 Freya changed the company's name to 
                    Coolio Games&trade;, taking her father's company into the digital world. Since then we
                    have produced many games for children globally, winning multiple awards. Now Coolio Games&trade; has been run by
                    Freddie since 2021 and he continues to push this company forward in his grandfather's vision.
                </p>
                <p>Here is a list of awards we have won:</p>
                <ul>
