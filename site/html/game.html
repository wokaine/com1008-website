                <p>
                    Normally games developed by Coolio Games are released for PC and console, but using highly advanced
                    technology we can bring the game straight to your browser! This game may be no where near as good
                    as our flagship titles but here at Coolio Games we're all about having fun!
                </p>
                <h2>Rules</h2>
                <p>
                    You will be shown three images and you will be told to identify all of the images on the screen based on a prompt, guess one correctly and you win a point. There are three rounds. You
                    can access the game by clicking the link below.
